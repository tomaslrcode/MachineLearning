# Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course

After seeing a presentation on a project my Artificial Intelligence Professor did I got hooked on the ideas of Machine Learning. Im pretty new but very motivated to learn. A few of my friends recommended the course as well as hearing about it alot on Quora I decided to take the plunge. So far is going well. 

After finishing this course the next step will be to port the ideas and assignments of this course to Python. My reasoning is that Python and its frameworks seem  to be popular on work places so being able to also work with such codebases in a professional environment would be beneficial.

The solutions to the assignments were done on Matlab. If Matlab is not available Octave is a well working alternative. I just personally hate their GUI.
